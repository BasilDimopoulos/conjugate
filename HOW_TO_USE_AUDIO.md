## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### "I don't see the audio player"

**Check:**
1. Is the book newly created? (Old books don't have audio)
2. Did audio generation succeed? (Check console logs)
3. Try creating a NEW book from URL

### "Audio doesn't play"

**Try:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify S3 URL is accessible
3. Make sure ELEVENLABS_API_KEY is set in .env

### "Words don't highlight"

**This is normal!** Word sync is **estimate-based**:
- Uses: `current time / total duration × word count`
- Accurate enough for reading along
- May drift slightly over long articles
