# âœ… Language Detection & Custom Voice Updates

## What Was Enhanced

Three key improvements to the Content Reader feature:

1. âœ… **Auto-detect user's selected language**
2. âœ… **Use environment variables for voice IDs**
3. âœ… **Added Russian language support**

---

## 1. Automatic Language Detection

### What Changed

The system now automatically detects and selects the user's currently learning language!

**Before:**
- Always defaulted to Chinese
- User had to manually select their language every time

**After:**
- Detects language from user's profile (`mostRecentSkill`)
- Pre-selects in dropdown automatically
- Shows "(detecting...)" while loading
- Falls back to Chinese if not detected

### How It Works

```typescript
// On page load
const userLanguage = await getUserLanguage();
if (userLanguage) {
  setLanguage(userLanguage.toLowerCase());
}
```

### User Experience

```
User learning Greek:
1. Clicks "Add Content"
2. Language dropdown shows "Greek" (auto-selected)
3. User can paste Greek text immediately
4. No manual selection needed!
```

---

## 2. Environment Variable Voice Configuration

### What Changed

Voice IDs are now configurable via environment variables!

**Before:**
```typescript
// Hard-coded in code
const LANGUAGE_VOICES = {
  chinese: '21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM',
  greek: '21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM',
  // ... etc
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Configurable via .env
const LANGUAGE_VOICES = {
  chinese: process.env.CHINESE_ELEVEN_LABS_ID || 'default',
  greek: process.env.GREEK_ELEVEN_LABS_ID || 'default',
  // ... etc
};
```

### Environment Variables Added

```bash
# Add to .env to customize voices
CHINESE_ELEVEN_LABS_ID=your_custom_voice_id
JAPANESE_ELEVEN_LABS_ID=your_custom_voice_id
KOREAN_ELEVEN_LABS_ID=your_custom_voice_id
GREEK_ELEVEN_LABS_ID=your_custom_voice_id
SPANISH_ELEVEN_LABS_ID=your_custom_voice_id
FRENCH_ELEVEN_LABS_ID=your_custom_voice_id
RUSSIAN_ELEVEN_LABS_ID=your_custom_voice_id
```

### Benefits

âœ… **Easy customization** - Just add to `.env`  
âœ… **No code changes** - Configure without editing code  
âœ… **Per-language control** - Different voice for each language  
âœ… **Default fallbacks** - Works without configuration  
âœ… **Production-ready** - Different voices per environment

## 3. Russian Language Support

### What Changed

Added full support for Russian language learning!

**Features:**
- Russian option in language dropdown
- Russian voice configuration
- Cyrillic text support
- Word-based segmentation (not character-based)

**Environment Variable:**
```bash
RUSSIAN_ELEVEN_LABS_ID=21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM  # Default: Rachel
```

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/_services/user.ts`
**Added function:**
```typescript
export const getUserLanguage = async () => {
  // Gets mostRecentSkill from user's profile
  // Returns language name or null
}
```

### 2. `app/api/generate-audio/route.ts`
**Updated:**
- Voice IDs now from environment variables
- Added Russian support
- Sensible defaults for all languages

### 3. `app/(dashboard)/learn/add-content/page.tsx`
**Updated:**
- Fetches user's language on mount
- Pre-selects in dropdown
- Shows loading state
- Added Russian to language options
- Improved Korean support (character-based)

### 4. Documentation
**Created:**
- `ENV_VARIABLES_GUIDE.md` - Complete env var documentation

**Updated:**
- `CONTENT_READER_SETUP.md` - Reflects new structure

## Setup Instructions

### For Users Already Using the System:

**No action required!** Everything works with defaults.

### To Customize Voices:

**Step 1:** Find voice ID in [ElevenLabs Dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-lab)

**Step 2:** Add to `.env`:
```bash
GREEK_ELEVEN_LABS_ID=your_custom_voice_id
```

**Step 3:** Restart server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Technical Details

### Language Detection Flow

```
User Profile (Database)
        â†“
   mostRecentSkill: "Greek"
        â†“
   getUserLanguage()
        â†“
   "greek" (lowercase)
        â†“
   Dropdown pre-selected
```

### Voice Selection Priority

```
1. Check process.env.GREEK_ELEVEN_LABS_ID
        â†“ (if not set)
2. Use default for Greek: '21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM'
        â†“ (if somehow fails)
3. Fallback to first available voice
```

### Character vs Word Segmentation

```typescript
const isCJK = ['chinese', 'japanese', 'korean'].includes(language);

if (isCJK) {
  // "ä½ å¥½ä¸–ç•Œ" â†’ ["ä½ ", "å¥½", "ä¸–", "ç•Œ"]
  text.split('').filter(char => char.trim())
} else {
  // "Hello world" â†’ ["Hello", "world"]
  text.split(/\s+/).filter(word => word.trim())
}
```

## Testing

### Test Language Detection:

```bash
1. Ensure user has mostRecentSkill set (e.g., "Greek")
2. Go to /learn/add-content
3. Observe: Language dropdown shows "Greek" selected
4. Paste Greek text
5. Verify: Audio generates correctly
```

### Test Custom Voice:

```bash
1. Add GREEK_ELEVEN_LABS_ID=custom_id to .env
2. Restart server
3. Process Greek text
4. Verify: Audio uses custom voice
```

### Test Russian Support:

```bash
1. Select Russian from dropdown
2. Paste: "ÐŸÑ€Ð¸Ð²ÐµÑ‚ Ð¼Ð¸Ñ€"
3. Click "Process Text"
4. Verify: Words appear, audio generates
```

A: Go to [ElevenLabs Voice Lab](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-lab), select a voice, copy ID from URL or voice card.

**Q: Can I use the same voice for multiple languages?**
A: Yes! Just set multiple language IDs to the same voice ID.

**Q: What if language detection fails?**
A: System falls back to Chinese. User can manually select their language.

**Q: How do I change the default language?**
A: Change user's `mostRecentSkill` in database, or user selects manually in content reader.
