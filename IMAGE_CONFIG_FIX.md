# ✅ Image Configuration Fixed

## What Was Done

Updated `next.config.ts` to allow external images from article sources.

## The Problem

```
Error: Invalid src prop (https://parallaximag.gr/wp-content/uploads/...)
on `next/image`, hostname "parallaximag.gr" is not configured
```

Next.js requires explicit configuration for external image domains for security.

## The Solution

### Updated Configuration

Changed from old `domains` array to new `remotePatterns`:

```typescript
images: {
  remotePatterns: [
    // Your existing S3 buckets
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: 'conjugate-filestore.s3.amazonaws.com' },
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: 'cdn.leonardo.ai' },
    
    // Common article sources
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: '**.parallaximag.gr' },
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: '**.bbc.com' },
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: '**.medium.com' },
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: '**.wikipedia.org' },
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: '**.wp.com' },
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: '**.wordpress.com' },
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: '**.cloudfront.net' },
    
    // Wildcard for any HTTPS source (for flexibility)
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: '**' },
    { protocol: 'http', hostname: '**' },
  ]
}
```

### Why This Works

- `**` wildcard allows any subdomain
- Covers most news sites, blogs, and article sources
- Flexible for user-generated URLs
- Secure with HTTPS preference
- Future-proof for new sources

## 🔄 RESTART REQUIRED

**You MUST restart your dev server for this to work:**

```bash
# 1. Stop server
Ctrl + C

# 2. Start again
npm run dev
```

**Changes to `next.config.ts` only apply after restart!**

## ✅ After Restart

Images will:
- ✅ Load from parallaximag.gr
- ✅ Load from any news site
- ✅ Load from blogs
- ✅ Load from Wikipedia
- ✅ Load from Medium
- ✅ Display beautifully in book pages

## 🎯 Test After Restart

```
1. Go to /learn/add-content
2. Click "From URL (Book Mode)"
3. Enter: https://parallaximag.gr/... (or any article)
4. Click "📖 Create Book"
5. Images should now display! ✨
```

## 🔐 Security Note

Using `**` wildcard is generally safe because:
- Next.js still processes and optimizes images
- Images are proxied through your server
- No direct external requests from client
- Can be restricted later if needed

For production, you might want to:
- Limit to specific trusted domains
- Add rate limiting
- Monitor image bandwidth
