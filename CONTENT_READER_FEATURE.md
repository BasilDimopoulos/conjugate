## Usage Examples

5. Listen to audio to hear correct pronunciation
6. Return to learning and review new words
```

### Example 2: Children's Story

## Technical Details

### Word Segmentation

**CJK Languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean):**
- Character-by-character splitting
- Each character is clickable
- Preserves compound words

**European Languages (Greek, Spanish, French):**
- Space-delimited word splitting
- Whole words are clickable
- Handles contractions and hyphens

### Punctuation Handling

```typescript
// Cleaned for database lookup
cleanWord = word.replace(/[.,!?;:"""''„ÄÇÔºåÔºÅÔºüÔºõÔºö„ÄÅ]/g, '')

// Preserved for display
displayWord = "‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºå" // Keeps comma
```

### SRS Integration

When a word is added from content:
```javascript
{
  level: 1,                  // Beginner level
  repetitions: 0,            // First exposure
  easeFactor: 2.5,          // Standard difficulty
  interval: 1,               // Review in 1 day
  nextReviewTime: tomorrow,  // Scheduled
}
```

## UI/UX Design

### Color Scheme
- **Unknown words**: Transparent background, white border on hover
- **Known words**: `bg-purple-600/30` with `border-purple-500/50`
- **Hover effects**: Scale 1.05, lighter background
- **Audio button**: Blue (`bg-blue-600`)
- **Process button**: Purple (`bg-purple-600`)

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly text wrapping
- Touch-friendly click targets
- Responsive padding and spacing
- Works on all screen sizes

### Accessibility
- Clear visual indicators
- Hover tooltips
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast colors

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations:
1. **Batch word checking**: Single database query for all words
2. **Client-side state**: Immediate visual feedback
3. **Data URLs for audio**: No additional HTTP requests
4. **Efficient rendering**: React memo for word components

### Limitations:
1. **Text length**: Recommended max 500-1000 words for performance
2. **Audio size**: Large texts = larger audio files
3. **API rate limits**: ElevenLabs free tier has limits

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Can navigate to /learn/add-content
- [ ] Can select language

- [ ] Process button works
- [ ] Words display correctly
- [ ] Known words show purple background
- [ ] Unknown words are clickable

### Test Cases:

**Test 1: Chinese Text**
```
Input: "ÊàëÂñúÊ¨¢Â≠¶‰π†‰∏≠Êñá„ÄÇ"
Expected: 7 clickable characters
```

**Test 2: Greek Text**
```
Input: "ŒìŒµŒπŒ± œÉŒøœÖ, œÄœéœÇ ŒµŒØœÉŒ±Œπ;"
Expected: 4 clickable words (punctuation excluded)
```

**Test 3: Already Known Words**
```
Pre-condition: User has "‰Ω†Â•Ω" in deck
Input: "‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºåÊúãÂèãÔºÅ"
Expected: "‰Ω†" and "Â•Ω" show purple background
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Audio not generating
**Solution:** Check ELEVENLABS_API_KEY is set in .env

### Issue: Words not showing as known
**Solution:** Run Prisma migration to ensure UsersWord table is updated

### Issue: Can't click words
**Solution:** Check that userId is properly set (user logged in)

### Issue: Punctuation being added to deck
**Solution:** Check cleanWord regex in content.ts

## Success! üéâ

This feature transforms passive reading into active vocabulary building. Users can now learn from:
- News articles
- Blog posts
- Social media
- Song lyrics
- Movie subtitles
- Books and stories
- Any text content!

The combination of visual feedback, audio pronunciation, and SRS integration makes this a powerful language learning tool.
