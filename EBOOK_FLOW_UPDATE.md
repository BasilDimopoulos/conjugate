# 📖 Ebook-Like Content Flow + Audio Simplification

## ✅ Complete! Two major improvements implemented.

---

## 🔇 Change 1: Removed "Follow Along" Feature

### What Was Removed:
- ❌ Yellow word highlighting during audio playback
- ❌ Auto-page navigation following audio
- ❌ Word-by-word synchronization
- ❌ Complex tracking logic

### What Stayed:
- ✅ Audio player with play/pause
- ✅ Progress bar and time display
- ✅ Purple highlighting for words in your deck
- ✅ Click words to see flashcards
- ✅ Select text for translation
- ✅ Progressive audio generation

### Why This Change?
- The word sync wasn't accurate enough
- Simpler = more reliable
- Focus on reading, not following
- Audio as background, not guide

### Result:
```
Before:
Audio plays → Words highlight yellow → Page auto-flips

After:
Audio plays → You read at your own pace
```

**Cleaner, simpler, more reliable!**

## 📚 Change 2: Ebook-Like Content Wrapping

### Previous Chunking:
```
- Broke at paragraph boundaries
- Fixed 250 words per page
- Could leave pages half-empty
- Sometimes awkward breaks
```

### New Ebook-Style Chunking:
```
- Breaks at sentence boundaries
- Flows naturally like a real book
- 200 words per page (more natural)
- Better content distribution
```

### How It Works:

#### Before (Paragraph-Based):
```
Page 1:
┌────────────────────────┐
│ Paragraph 1...         │
│                        │
│ Paragraph 2...         │
│                        │
│ [Lots of empty space]  │
│                        │
└────────────────────────┘

Page 2:
┌────────────────────────┐
│ Paragraph 3 (very long │
│ continues for entire   │
│ page and more...)      │
└────────────────────────┘
```

#### After (Sentence-Based):
```
Page 1:
┌────────────────────────┐
│ Sentence 1. Sentence   │
│ 2. Sentence 3. Sent-   │
│ ence 4. Sentence 5.    │
│ Sentence 6. Sentence   │
│ 7. Sentence 8.         │
│                        │
└────────────────────────┘

Page 2:
┌────────────────────────┐
│ Sentence 9. Sentence   │
│ 10. Sentence 11. Sen-  │
│ tence 12. Sentence 13. │
│ Sentence 14.           │
│                        │
└────────────────────────┘
```

### Technical Changes:

**Improved `chunkIntoPages` function:**

```typescript
// Before: Split by paragraphs
const paragraphs = text.split(/\n\n+/)

// After: Split by sentences for better flow
const sentences = text.split(/([.!?。！？]\s+)/)

// Reduced page size for better wrapping
wordsPerPage: 200  // Was 250

// Breaks at sentence boundaries
if (currentWordCount + sentenceWords > wordsPerPage) {
  // Create new page - natural break!
}
```

### Benefits:

**1. Natural Flow:**
- Content wraps like a real ebook
- Sentences don't get awkwardly split
- Pages feel more balanced

**2. Better Reading:**
- Each page has similar density
- No large empty spaces
- Easier to know when to turn page

**3. More Pages:**
- Smaller chunks = more pages
- Better sense of progress
- Easier to remember position

**4. Smarter Breaks:**
- Always breaks at sentence end
- Maintains readability
- Feels like a published book

## 📊 Comparison:

### Article: 1000 words

**Before (Paragraph Chunking):**
```
- Pages: ~4 pages (250 words each)
- Breaks: At paragraph boundaries
- Flow: Can be uneven
- Empty space: Variable
```

**After (Sentence Chunking):**
```
- Pages: ~5 pages (200 words each)
- Breaks: At sentence boundaries
- Flow: Smooth and even
- Empty space: Minimal
```

---

## 🎨 User Experience:

### Before:
```
Page 1: [Full paragraph + half of next]
Turn page
Page 2: [Rest of paragraph + new para...]
Turn page
Page 3: [Long paragraph takes whole page]
```
**Feels choppy** 😕

### After:
```
Page 1: [Sentences flow naturally...]
Turn page
Page 2: [More sentences continue...]
Turn page
Page 3: [Content wraps smoothly...]
```
**Feels like a real book!** 📖✨

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details:

### 1. Sentence Detection:
```typescript
// Splits on sentence endings
text.split(/([.!?。！？]\s+)/)

// Handles:
// - English: . ! ?
// - Greek: . ! ;
// - CJK: 。！？
```

### 2. Word Counting:
```typescript
// For Latin scripts
const words = sentence.split(/\s+/).filter(w => w).length;

// For CJK languages
const words = sentence.split('').length;
```

### 3. Page Creation:
```typescript
// When page is full
if (currentWordCount + sentenceWords > 200) {
  // Save current page
  pages.push({ content: currentPageContent });
  
  // Start new page with current sentence
  currentPageContent = sentence;
}
```

### 4. Image Distribution:
```typescript
// Distribute images evenly across pages
if (pages.length % Math.ceil(10 / images.length) === 0) {
  imageIndex++;
}
```
