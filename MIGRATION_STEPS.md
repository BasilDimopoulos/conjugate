# 🔧 Migration Steps - E-Book Reader & Content Library

## ⚠️ Important: Stop Dev Server First!

The Prisma client files are locked while the dev server is running.

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Stop Your Development Server

**In your terminal where `npm run dev` is running:**
```
Press Ctrl + C
```

Wait for the server to fully stop.

### Step 2: Run the Migration Script

**Windows:**
```bash
.\migrate-srs.bat
```

**Or manually:**
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_srs_and_content_library
npx prisma generate
```

This will:
- ✅ Add SRS fields to UsersWord
- ✅ Create UserContent model
- ✅ Add book-specific fields
- ✅ Generate Prisma client

### Step 3: Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test the Features

**Test URL to Book:**
```
1. Navigate to /learn/add-content
2. Click "From URL (Book Mode)" tab
3. Enter URL: https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-67890123
   (or any article URL in your target language)
4. Click "📖 Create Book"
5. Watch the magic happen! ✨
```
