# 🔧 Fix: RapidAPI 403 Forbidden Error

## ❌ Error You're Seeing:

```
RapidAPI error: 403 Forbidden
Failed to get audio URL
```

---

## 🎯 What This Means:

**403 Forbidden** typically means:
1. **You haven't subscribed to the API** (most common!)
2. Your API key is incorrect
3. You're using the wrong endpoint

---

## ✅ Solution:

### Step 1: Make Sure You're Subscribed

**Visit:** https://rapidapi.com/ytjar/api/youtube-mp36

**Check if you see:**
- "You are subscribed to this API" ✅

**If you see:**
- "Subscribe to Test" button ❌

**Then you need to click "Subscribe" and select the FREE Basic plan!**

---

### Step 2: Verify Your API Key

**On the API page:**
1. Look at the "Header Parameters" or "Code Snippets" section
2. You should see:
   ```
   'x-rapidapi-key': 'your-key-here-123abc...'
   ```
3. **Copy this EXACT key** (should be 50+ characters)
4. Make sure it's in your `.env` file:
   ```env
   RAPIDAPI_KEY=your-key-here-123abc...
   ```

---

### Step 3: Restart Server

**After adding/updating the key:**
```bash
Ctrl+C  (stop server)
npm run dev  (start again)
```

**Wait for:** "Ready in X ms"

## 🎯 The System Will Try 3 Different APIs:

I've updated the code to try multiple RapidAPI services:

1. **YouTube Media Downloader** (recommended)
2. **YouTube v3**
3. **Social Media Video Downloader**

**You only need to subscribe to ONE of them!**

---

## 💡 Recommended API:

**Best option:** YouTube MP3 Converter
- **URL:** https://rapidapi.com/ytjar/api/youtube-mp36
- **Free tier:** 500 requests/month
- **Reliable:** Professional service

## ⚠️ Still Getting 403?

### Double-Check:

**1. API Key Format:**
```env
# WRONG (missing key)
RAPIDAPI_KEY=

# WRONG (has quotes)
RAPIDAPI_KEY="abc123..."

# RIGHT ✅
RAPIDAPI_KEY=abc123def456ghi789...
```

**2. API Subscription:**
- Make sure you actually clicked "Subscribe"
- Refresh the API page to confirm
- Should see "You are subscribed"

**3. Server Restart:**
- `.env` changes require server restart
- Stop with Ctrl+C
- Start with `npm run dev`

## 📞 Need Help?

**Check these:**
